# embparpbar

Embarrassingly Parallel with a Progress Bar

## Description

The ``Pool`` class from the multiprocessing is quite nice. What it lacks
however, is a progress bar. This module seeks to remedy that by providing a
ProgressPool.

The progress bar is from: http://code.google.com/p/python-progressbar/

## Installation

Everything is in the file ``embparpbar.py`` , so just drop that file to where
you want to use it.
