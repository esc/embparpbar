# embparpbar

Embarrassingly Parallel with a Progress Bar

## Description

The ``Pool`` class from the multiprocessing is quite nice. What it lacks
however, is a progress bar. This module seeks to remedy that by providing a
ProgressPool.

The progress bar is from: http://code.google.com/p/python-progressbar/

## Installation

Everything is in the file ``embparpbar.py`` , so just drop that file to where
you want to use it.

## Usage

See the
[example.py](https://github.com/esc/embparpbar/blob/d94cd5c801aae9d1e41db4942ad2a681bebe4da2/example.py).
for details.

It will look like::

    zshÂ» ./example.py
    Using a normal Pool... you never know when it is done...
    Oh... finally... it has completed...


    Now using a ProgressPool... enjoy the ride! :D
    ProgressPool: 100%|###############################################|Time: 00:00:20

    Now using a ProgressPool, with a custom progressbar! :D
    Come on baby, let's do the twist:  ||| Time: 00:00:22
